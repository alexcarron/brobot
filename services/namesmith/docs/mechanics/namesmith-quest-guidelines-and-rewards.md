# Namesmith Quest Guidelines and Rewards
Optional, time-limited mini goals that give players clear, objective challenges to complete in exchange for rewards (tokens, characters, boxes, or perks).
## Guiding Principles
1. Quests should allow some amount of freedom for how players achieve it. It should be an exact set of steps that players have to follow. Multiple players should be able to complete the quest in different, fun, unique ways
2. Quests must feel achievable with effort, not grinding, random chance, or no effort. Begin with easiers quests before progressing in difficulty without making them so easy they are boring or so hard they are frustrating
3. Quests must not be predictable or uninspired (i.e. earn 10 tokens). Add small twists that surprise or inspire curiosity.
4. Make some quests social in nature
5. Quest rewards must always loop back into the main economy and core gameplay loop to provide player's progression. Do not give meaningless rewards.
6. Quests must be programmable such that whether or not a quest has been completed is always objective and not up to interpretation or ambigious (i.e. Make a name that fits a the theme, "Alien")
