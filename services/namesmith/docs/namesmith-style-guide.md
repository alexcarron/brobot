## Tone & Voice

- Always speak to the player with "you."
- Be all-Knowing: Speak with complete understanding of the game and its mechanics
- Be clear and direct: Everything stated should be immeiately understandable with players always knowing what their options are
- Be concise but complete: Give only necessary information; avoid filler or flowery language.
- Speak in present tense, second-person perspective
- No metaphors, similes, or figurative language
- Use simple, precise verbs
- Avoid adjectives unless they convey functional information
- Be instructional and factual
- Encourage players for completing challenges in a subtle, understated, minimal, and neutral way (i.e. Well done, Good job, Nicely done, Good work)
- Show progress and rewards visibly using numbers, counts, symbols, size, or repeated icons
- Suspense: Make spins, loot boxes, and choices feel tense only from visuals or these very minimal statements (i.e. Opening mystery box...)
