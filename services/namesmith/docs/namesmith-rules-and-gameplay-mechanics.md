# Namesmith Rules and Gameplay Mechanics
## Objective
In Namesmith, your goal is to create the most liked, clever, or creative name possible using the limited set of characters you receive from mystery boxes, crafting, trades, roles, perks, and quests. Your name will be judged by all other players at the end of the month, and the player whose name receives the most votes wins 100 LL Points!
## Things Player's Have
1. **Inventory**: All of the different characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.) that you currently own. This can hold an infinite number of characters. Use `/see-inventory` to see your own or a given player's current inventory
2. **Name**: Your currently displayed name that can published to be "locked in". It must be 32 characters or less. You can pick and choose which characters from your inventory you want in your name using`/rearrange-name`
3. **Published Name** Your currently locked in name that will be displayed when it's time to vote for the best name. Use `/publish-name` to make your current name your published name
4. **Tokens**: The currency you can use to buy mystery boxes to earn characters from
5. **Perks**: Permanent effects that stay with you for the entire game to give you strategic benefits. . Twice a week, you can pick a perk out of three shown to keep
6. **A Role**: A permanent label and set of perks you choose at the start of the game and keep for the entire game
## Earning Tokens
1. **Mining Tokens**: You can run `/mine-tokens` in \#mine-tokens to earn a small amount of tokens. You can spam this as many times as you want since there's no cooldown or limit. It typically awards 1-2 tokens.
2. **Claiming Refills**: You can run `/claim-refill` in \#claim-refill every 2 hours to earn a decent amount of tokens periodically. It typically awards 50-100 tokens, but can vary wildly.
3. **Complete Quests**: You can complete quests listed in \#quests to receive rewards, which can include tokens, characters, mystery boxes, or perks. You must complete the listed criteria to earn the rewards when completing the quest.
## Getting Characters
1. **Buying Mystery Box**: You can run `/buy-mystery-box` in \#buy-mystery-boxes to purchase a mystery box of your choice using tokens. Buying a box immediately opens it and gives you a random character from its contents. There are different box types available like Letters, Vowels, Numbers, etc. Just typing `/buy-mystery-box` will allow you to see every mystery box, it's cost, and the characters it contains.
2. **Trading Characters**: You can run `/trade` in \#trade-characters to initiate a trade with another player, allowing you to exchange characters. If the recipient accepts your trade using the buttons below the trade request message, you will exchange the characters listed in the trade request. They also have the option to decline the trade or modify the exchanged characters and wait for your response.
3. **Crafting Characters**: You can run `/craft-characters` in \#craft-characters to use a given recipe to convert characters you own into new characters. Crafting recipes often use Utility Characters which represent actions like Rotate, Flip, Shift, etc. to achieve the desired character(s). You can recieve these from the Recipe Utilities mystery box.
	- **Recipe**: A unique set of input characters and output charcters you can use to convert characters you own into other characters
## Creating Your Name
1. **Rearrange Your Name**: You can run `/rearrange-name` anywhere to change your current name. You may use any characters you have in your inventory.
2. **Publish Your Name**: You can run `/publish-name` anywhere to publish your current name, locking it in to be the name shown during voting. You can always publish a new name at any time.
3. **Vote for a Name**: At the end of the game a `#names-to-vote-on` channel will appear with every published name. You can press the buttons shown to vote for your favorite.
## Roles and Perks
1. **Picking a Perk**: Twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday, new perks will be displayed in \#pick-a-perk that you can choose from. During that time, you can press one of the buttons to pick a perk of the ones shown you want to gain permanently. You cannot switch perks or choose more than one.
2. **Choosing a Role**: At the start of the game, roles you can choose from will be displayed in \#choose-a-role. Each role will offer a fixed set of perks that you will have for the entire game. You can press one of the buttons to choose one of the roles to have permanently. You cannot switch roles or choose more than one.
## Voting for a Winner
Once the time allocated for creating a name has passed, anyone who has never published name will have their current name automatically published. Every player's current name will be displayed in \#names-to-vote-on with a button to vote it as their favorite. Any user on the Discord server can vote for their favorite name. Whoever has the most votes by the time voting is over is declared the winner.
