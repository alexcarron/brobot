### Discord API

The Discord API allows developers to interact programmatically with Discord's platform, enabling bots to perform actions such as sending messages, banning users, or modifying server settings.

### Bot Token

A unique, secret string of characters that authenticates your bot with the Discord API. The token is required to run the bot and authorize it to take actions on Discord.

### Discord.js

A powerful JavaScript library that simplifies interaction with the Discord API, providing a set of easy-to-use functions for bot development.

### Client

The `Client` is an object that represents the bot itself and manages the connection between the bot and Discord's servers, handling events and interactions.
