{"events":[{"_name":"Project Sekai Showdown","_plan":"Yo! I‚Äôll be (hopefully) hosting a Game Show on Sunday at 12 pm (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be a Project Sekai contest‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve already mentioned the main rules for those who were there but I‚Äôll repost them in a minute‚Ä¶ anyways go download the game and get the content ready (it‚Äôs a small app with a big extra download you HAVE to do) if you‚Äôre interested‚Ä¶\nIn Project Sekai you let the audience decide what song you‚Äôll play and what difficulty (from easy to master [If unlocked for both players] ).\n\nWin by:\nBetter accuracy (All Perfect beats Full Combo. Full combo beats TFC etc.)\nHigher difficulty (Master beats all on the Global Version except on the Japanese Version [Append beats all] ).\n\nLimitations:\nNo level 31+ experts (e.g. The EmpErroR, Machinegun Poem Doll, Intense Voice/Disappearance of Hatsune Miku.) unless both players can clear them!\nPlayers are permitted only 1 birthday character if they have acquired them\nA full team of healers is not allowed unless that player has no birthday characters.\nIf only one player has the Japanese version of the game then they are not permitted to play it. (Like me compared to LL)\n\nExceptions!\nPlayers (like me) who only have the Japanese version of the game are allowed to use it but they cannot use APD (Append) difficulty or any charts that are not available on the English/Global version of the game (Such as ‰∏ãÂâã‰∏ä, Beyond The Way and C.R.A.Z.Y!)\n*Tfc is a Technical Full Combo where you don‚Äôt miss any notes but lose combo by hitting a bad (Damage + Combo loss) or good note (Just Combo loss)","_instructions":"- Download Project Sekai\n- Join the voice chat and stream\n- Follow instructions in VC","_summary":"Join us for a thrilling Project Sekai Game Show where you can compete against fellow players and showcase your skills.
